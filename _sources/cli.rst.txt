Command-line interface
======================

**GAMuT** (`v1.0.6` or older) comes with a simple but convenient command-line interface (CLI) utility, which can be especially helpful if you're brand new to Python, or even programming.

Once :doc:`installed <./installation>`, we can check the **GAMuT** package version and test it, by running:

.. code:: shell

   gamut --version
   gamut --test

If you see a success message afterwards, it means we're all set.

Quickstart
--------------

When working with **GAMuT**'s command-line interface utility, there are two main aways of doing audio musaicking:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   Option 1: Direct input arguments <cli/raw-args>
   Option 2: GAMuT workspace <cli/workspace>
