Getting started
===============

.. hint::
   Before starting, make sure you have installed the **GAMuT** package. If not, please read the :doc:`installation guide<./installation>`.

There are **three different ways** in which you can learn how to use **GAMuT**, depending on your background, experience, and/or eagerness to start using it:
   
   * **Graphical user interface**: recommended if you have little to no programming experience. Although it's still in its beta stage, it's a very convenient and user-friendly way to get started. You can learn more about it :doc:`here<./gui/overview>`.
   * **Command line utility**: recommended if you have programming experience but are not familiar with Python. You can learn more about it :doc:`here <./cli>`.
   * **Python package**: recommended if you want to take full advantage of **GAMuT**. Below you will find some tutorials to get started.


Tutorials
-------------------

The following tutorial series will incrementally show you how to use **GAMuT** and what you can do with it.

Although it assumes a basic understanding of Python and computer programming concepts, it hopes to be an
approachable and user-friendly guide to `audio musaicking`, for musicians, sound designers, programmers, and audio
enthusiasts with varying degrees of experience.
