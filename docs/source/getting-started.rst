Getting started
===============

The following tutorial series will incrementally show you how to use **GAMuT** and what you can do with it.

Although it assumes a basic understanding of Python and computer programming concepts, it hopes to be an
approachable and user-friendly guide to `audio musaicing`, for musicians, sound designers, programmers, and audio
enthusiasts with varying degrees of experience.

However, **if you're brand new to Python** and would like to try **GAMuT** without writing any Python code, you may want to start :doc:`here <./command-line-interface>`.

.. hint::
   Before starting, make sure you have installed the **GAMuT** package. If not, make sure to read the :doc:`./installation` guide.
