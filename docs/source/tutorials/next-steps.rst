Next steps
============================

If you've come this far, you're more than ready to take full advantage of what **GAMuT** has to offer.
However, it might be useful from time to time to check the :doc:`../modules`, to understand in more depth
how **GAMuT** works, and what it can do.

Aside from that, everyone is welcome to either **contribute** to the development of **GAMuT** on 
`Github <https://github.com/felipetovarhenao/gamut>`_, **support** the project with `donations <https://paypal.me/felipetovarhenao>`_, 
or **share** it with other people to help grow the user base.
