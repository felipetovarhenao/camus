Tutorial 5: Audio musaicing parameters
=================================================

One of the main advantages of the ``Mosaic`` class, is that is allows to generate different audio mosaic versions
from the same instance, or `corpus-target` pairing. In other words, a ``Mosaic`` instance works as a virtual representation, 
or **blueprint** of an `audio mosaic`, rather than the `audio mosaic` itself. This allows to play and experiment with
different settings, hear the results, all without having to rebuild the ``Corpus`` and/or the ``Mosaic`` from scratch everytime.
Thus, the resulting audio will depend on the many audio parameters one can pass to the ``to_audio()`` method.

To demonstrate this, let's consider different cases with the same ``Mosaic`` instance.

.. code:: python

	from gamut.features import Mosaic

	# first load .gamut mosaic from disk
	mosaic = Mosaic().read('/path/to/my_mosaic.gamut')

Now, let's generate audio using the default arguments:

.. code:: python

	# convert to audio mosaic using arguments and play it.
	mosaic.to_audio().play()

Optionally, we can pass different arguments to fine-tune the final output. For instance, setting the `grain duration`:

.. code:: python

	# set grain duration to 0.5 seconds
	mosaic.to_audio(grain_dur=0.5).play()

As with most of arguments in the ``to_audio()`` method, we can use a ``list`` of values to dynamically (i.e., over time) change the parameter.

.. code:: python

	# set grain duration, gradually changing from 0.1 to 0.5 seconds, over the duration of the audio file
	mosaic.to_audio(grain_dur=[0.1, 0.5]).play()

Similarly we can customize the grain envelope:

.. code:: python

	env = [0, 1, 0.25, 0.25, 0]
	mosaic.to_audio(grain_env=env).play

This would result in the following grain envelope:

.. image:: ../_static/grain-env-1.png
	:height: 250px

.. warning::
	When specifying envelopes as a ``list``, make sure than you're envelope starts and ends in ``0``. Otherwise, you'll likely get audio clippings in the audio output.


Another convenient way of specifying time-varying or `dynamic` parameters, is through a 
``list`` of ``tuples``, here each ``tuple`` is the (`x, y`) coordinates of the parameter â€” 
`x` being time, and `y` being the parameter value. 

.. code:: python
	
	env = [
		(0, 0), 
		(1, 1), 
		(2, 0.25), 
		(10, 0),
	]
	mosaic.to_audio(grain_env=env).play

This results is the following envelope:

.. image:: ../_static/grain-env-2.png
	:height: 250px

.. note::
	When specifying a control parameter as a ``tuple`` ``list``, make sure the `x` values are in incremental order.
	For instance, these would throw an error: ``[(0, 0), (0, 1)]``` or ``[(0, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)]```

Finally, let's a more complex version, changin more than a single parameter.

In this case, we'll change:

* ``corpus_weights``: This controls the likelihood of using the `corpus` (instead of the original audio `target`) for a given segment or `grain`. By default, this is set to ``1``. Although it's not quite the same, this is somewhat equivalent to control the dry-wet mix between corpus and target.
* ``grain_env``: grain envelope.
* ``grain_dur``: grain duration, in seconds.
* ``stretch_factor``: inverse playback rate, where 2 is twice as slow, and 0.5 is twice as fast.

.. code:: python

	# gradual change, from only using grains in corpus
	# to only using grains in original audio target
	corpus_weights = [1, 0]

	# a somewhat sharp and percussive grain envelope
	grain_env = [
		(0, 0),
		(1, 1),
		(2, 0.5),
		(15, 0),
	]
	# playback at original speed (1.0), and half way gradually slow down to twice the speed (2.0)
	stretch_factor = [1, 1, 2]

	audio = mosaic.to_audio(
		grain_env=grain_env,
		corpus_weights=corpus_weights,
		grain_env=grain_env,
	)

	# playback audio
	audio.play()

	# write audio to disk
	audio.write('./my_cool_audio_mosaic.wav')
